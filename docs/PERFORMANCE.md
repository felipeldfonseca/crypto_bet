# üöÄ Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented in the Crypto Bet frontend application.

## üìä Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

**File**: `next.config.mjs`

- **Bundle Splitting**: Intelligent code splitting with separate chunks for:
  - Vendor dependencies (stable libraries)
  - Solana-specific dependencies (large blockchain libraries)
  - UI components (reusable components)
- **Compiler Optimizations**: 
  - Console.log removal in production
  - SWC minification
  - Optimized package imports
- **Image Optimization**: AVIF/WebP formats with 30-day caching
- **Headers**: DNS prefetch control and security headers
- **Bundle Analysis**: Integrated `@next/bundle-analyzer` for monitoring

### 2. React Component Optimizations

**Files**: Various component files

- **React.memo**: Implemented on all major components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useMemo**: Memoized expensive calculations and object creations
- **useCallback**: Memoized event handlers and functions
- **Context Optimization**: Memoized context values to prevent cascading re-renders

### 3. Context Provider Performance

**Files**: `BettingModeProvider.tsx`, `ThemeProvider.tsx`

- **Memoized Context Values**: Prevents unnecessary provider re-renders
- **Optimized State Updates**: Batched DOM updates using `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Debounced Operations**: Theme changes debounced to prevent excessive DOM manipulation
- **Cleanup Functions**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners

### 4. Performance Utilities

**File**: `lib/performance.ts`

- **Debounce/Throttle**: High-performance utility functions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance measurement tools
- **Memory Monitoring**: Memory usage tracking
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Utilities for large list optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Enhanced lazy loading with error boundaries

### 5. Custom Performance Hooks

**File**: `hooks/usePerformance.ts`

- **Component Performance Tracking**: Monitor render times and re-render counts
- **Operation Tracking**: Track expensive operations with warnings
- **Bundle Monitoring**: Analyze bundle size impact in development

## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Monitoring Tools

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze
```
Generates interactive bundle analysis report showing:
- Bundle sizes by chunk
- Dependency tree visualization
- Optimization opportunities

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
npm run dev
```
Development mode includes:
- Component render tracking
- Performance warnings for slow operations
- Memory usage monitoring
- Bundle size analysis

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run type-check
```
Ensures TypeScript optimizations are maintained.

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization (Baseline)
- Initial bundle size: ~2.5MB
- First Contentful Paint: ~1.2s
- Time to Interactive: ~2.8s
- Re-render frequency: High (unoptimized)

### After Optimization (Target)
- Bundle size reduction: ~30-40%
- First Contentful Paint: <800ms
- Time to Interactive: <1.5s
- Re-render frequency: Minimized with memoization

## üéØ Optimization Strategies by Scale

### Small Scale (Current)
- ‚úÖ Component memoization
- ‚úÖ Context optimization
- ‚úÖ Bundle splitting
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring

### Medium Scale (100-1000 users)
- üîÑ Implement lazy loading for landing sections
- üîÑ Add service worker for caching
- üîÑ Optimize image loading with intersection observer
- üîÑ Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

### Large Scale (1000+ users)
- üìã Server-side rendering optimization
- üìã CDN integration for static assets
- üìã Database query optimization
- üìã Implement micro-frontends architecture

## üîß Development Best Practices

### Component Development
1. Always wrap components in `React.memo` when appropriate
2. Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
3. Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
4. Avoid creating objects/arrays in render functions

### Context Usage
1. Split contexts by concern to minimize re-renders
2. Memoize context values
3. Use context selectors for large state objects

### Bundle Optimization
1. Use dynamic imports for large dependencies
2. Implement code splitting at route level
3. Optimize third-party library imports
4. Regular bundle analysis to catch regressions

## üö® Performance Warnings

The application includes built-in warnings for:
- Components re-rendering more than 10 times
- Operations taking longer than 100ms (sync) or 500ms (async)
- Memory usage spikes
- Large bundle chunks

## üìä Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze

# Build with performance profiling
npm run build

# Type check without building
npm run type-check

# Development with performance monitoring
npm run dev
```

## üîç Performance Debugging

### Using Browser DevTools
1. **Performance Tab**: Record and analyze component render times
2. **Memory Tab**: Monitor memory usage and detect leaks
3. **Network Tab**: Analyze bundle loading times
4. **Lighthouse**: Regular performance audits

### Using Custom Hooks
```tsx
import { usePerformance } from '@/hooks/usePerformance';

function MyComponent() {
  const { logMetrics } = usePerformance('MyComponent');
  
  // Log performance metrics
  useEffect(() => {
    logMetrics();
  }, []);
  
  return <div>Component content</div>;
}
```

## üéØ Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements
1. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for landing page sections
2. **Service Worker**: Add for offline functionality and caching
3. **Image Optimization**: Implement responsive images with next/image
4. **Database Optimization**: Optimize Solana RPC calls
5. **Micro-frontends**: Consider for large-scale architecture

### Monitoring & Alerts
1. Set up performance budgets
2. Implement automated performance testing
3. Add performance regression alerts
4. Create performance dashboards
